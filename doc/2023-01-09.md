# Setup FsLexTacc starter
Ensuring it can be build and run. Based on the project created by Oliver for Computer Science Modelling last year: (https://gitlab.gbar.dtu.dk/s184229/FsLexYacc-Starter). Setting Docker and JSON, such that it easily can be tested on the tester :)

# Serializing F# types

Serializing to JSON in F# was surprisingly hard. The default JSON serializer (`System.Text.Json.Serialization`) did not support discriminated unions, and we thus had to rely on using an external lib. `Newtonsoft.Json` turned out to work out for us, even though the generated string was a bit verbose.

# Rust Reference Implementation
Started on the AST to be used for the generating of programs. We started on implementing MicroC by mistake (Oliver :)), it is now changed to Guarded Commands.


# Generation of programs
Started constructing a generator based on the AST of the Rust reference implementation. Implemented a formatter for the programs. The different productions have been given different weight distributions to try mimic realistic and useable programs.


# Following the task description
We follow the task description given to the students. For task 1, we do not need a parser (yet), and have only implemented the AST and the formatter. For the second task we implement the compiler from AST to PG. All of this is in the Rust reference implementation.
