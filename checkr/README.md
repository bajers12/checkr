# checkr

The checkr crate is the core analysis code for the checkr project. It
contains code for parsing the Guarded Command Language variant, running
analysis on them, infrastructure for generating random programs and inputs,
and a way to communicate with external implementations of the same analysis.

## Reading documentation

The best way to get familiar with `checkr`, is to read the documentation in the source code:

```bash
cargo doc -p checkr --open
```
